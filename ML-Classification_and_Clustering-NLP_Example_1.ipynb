       "[\"SoftBank's $100 Billion Tech Fund Rankles VCs as Valuations Soar: In the months since Softbank Group Corp. unveiled plans for a $100 billion technology fund, the Japanese company has been making its presence deeply felt across the industry. The Vision Fund closed a few days ago with $93 billion in initial commitments, and already venture firms from London to Silicon Valley are fretting about a behemoth with the resources, clout and name recognition to snatch away the most promising deals. Just last week, SoftBank swooped in and pumped $1.4 billion into Paytm, India s largest digital-payments startup. The deal boosted Paytm's valuation by about 40 percent to $7 billion. That's not outlandish given Paytm's dominant market position, but the valuations of other SoftBank deals have prompted head-scratching and ignited alarm that a funding atmosphere that only recently cooled off will heat up again. there's the concern that SoftBank will ladle out more money than startups need or can absorb. Already founders approached by SoftBank are caught between the desire to take the money and concern about handing over too much control of their company, according to an investor. One startup targeted by SoftBank has tried to negotiate for less money, this person says. SoftBank won't budge; it's a big check or nothing. SoFi originally asked for less money, too, according to another investor. Pushing startups to take more cash than they ask for has been Son's strategy since the beginning. SoftBank invested more money in Yahoo, Alibaba and Didi than what the entrepreneurs had initially wanted. \",\n",
       " 'Quora tests video answers to steal Q&A from YouTube: Newly-minted unicorn Quora has even bigger ambitions than text questions-and-answers. And it s not going to let video giants or startups disrupt its future. This week Quora began testing video answers, because sometimes it s a lot easier to show someone how something works, the best way to complete a task, or why one thing is better than another than try to write it out for them. Users in the beta group will be able to record videos on iOS or Android as supplements or complete answers that everyone on Quora can watch. It s considering allowing video uploads, which might offer more polished content but increase spam concerns. Previously, Quora only let users answer with text, natively hosted photos, links, and embedded videos from platforms like YouTube. Now it s actively hosting and soliciting video uploads. Quora s entry into the space could box out younger competitors like Justin Kan s mobile video Q&A app Whale, and video Ask Me Anything app Yam. These apps are focused entirely on simplifying the process of recording video answers to questions with features like filters to make you look better, and both give creators ways to earn money. But Quora s 190 million users, $226 million in funding, and 8-year head start give it a big edge. It s been cautiously curating a network of experts and content, while building a brand name known for quality in contrast to its predecessor Yahoo Answers. Its network effect may be tough to break.',\n",
       " 'Pittsburgh Welcomed Uber s Driverless Car Experiment. Not Anymore. When Uber picked this former Rust Belt town as the inaugural city for its driverless car experiment, Pittsburgh played the consummate host.  You can either put up red tape or roll out the red carpet,  Bill Peduto, the mayor of Pittsburgh, said in September.  If you want to be a 21st-century laboratory for technology, you put out the carpet.  Nine months later, Pittsburgh residents and officials say Uber has not lived up to its end of the bargain. Among Uber s perceived transgressions: The company began charging for driverless rides that were initially pitched as free. It also withdrew support from Pittsburgh s application for a $50 million federal grant to revamp transportation. And it has not created the jobs it proposed in a struggling neighborhood that houses its autonomous car testing track. The deteriorating relationship between Pittsburgh and Uber offers a cautionary tale, especially as other cities consider rolling out driverless car trials from Uber, Alphabet s Waymo and others.',\n",

       " 'Why Did a Chinese Peroxide Company Pay $1 Billion for a Talking Cat  Even by the opaque standards of Chinese mergers and acquisitions, the deal was a head-scratcher. It s hard to see the synergies between a maker of chemical solvents and a digital cat perched over a toilet. And curiously, the buyer, which had recently been renamed Zhejiang Jinke Entertainment Culture Co., had revenue of only $133 million in 2016, according to Bloomberg data pulled from regulatory filings, and its gross profit was $55 million. Jinke won t say where the money to buy Outfit7 came from. Talking Tom is not alone. There s been a recent flurry of oddball pairings between Chinese industrial interests and Western entertainment companies. A real estate magnate in Beijing bought Legendary Entertainment, the movie studio that made the Dark Knight trilogy, for $3.5 billion. A maker of construction materials bought Framestore, the company behind the special effects in the Harry Potter films. Zhejiang Dragon Pipe Manufacturing Co. acquired app developer Entertainment Game Labs. And perhaps strangest of all, Digital Extremes Ltd., which created an alien battle game, and the studio Splash Damage Ltd., which made an offshoot of the Xbox hit Gears of War, were bought by an enormous Chinese poultry processor. According to CODE Advisors LLC, an investment bank that specializes in media and technology deals, 70 percent of all acquisitions of game companies since 2015 have been by Chinese buyers. Samo, for one, isn t stopping to ask questions. A vegan, he s using his windfall to start a food-sustainability foundation.  It s not easy,  he says,  to find buyers for a $1 billion company.  The deal activity can best be understood as a consequence of quirks in the Chinese stock market. In China, industrial companies trade at valuations they d never receive elsewhere in the world. Affan Butt, an investment banker who helped facilitate the sale of Jagex, says some may trade at as much as 100 times their annual earnings more than four times the multiple of General Electric Co. This means they can acquire companies at what is effectively a discount. A target like Jagex is worth more once it s part of a Chinese-listed company, allowing the acquirer to pay prices that appear bafflingly high to the rest of the world. ',\n",

If you use Google's Gmail app, you may have seen something new pop up on your screen this week: suggested responses for your emails. The move illustrates one way that Google is using its increased focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning. If you're wondering why and how Google can make these suggestions, here are some answers about the feature and how it works. Google calls the feature Smart Reply, and it s pretty much what it sounds like. Google algorithms are scanning your messages and using the information it gleans to suggest ways that you could reply to any given message. Smart Reply relies on machine learning to scan the subject line and body of an email and make suggestions based on what it sees. The company said it has built up a huge bank of anonymized customer messages and response decisions to help accomplish this. It is also designed to remember your individual preferences for things, such as punctuation. So it will be able to adjust its suggestions depending on whether you're a  Thanks!  or  Thanks.  type of person. Smart Replies won't appear on every email though, Google said. You're most likely to see response suggestions on emails that can be easily answered with a simple sentence or two.\",\n",

Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, chairman of Softbank, a telecommunications and tech investment group, revealed plans for the fund last October and since then it has obtained commitments from some of the world's most deep-pocketed investors.  In addition to Softbank and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), the new fund's investors include Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment, which has committed $15 billion, Apple Inc, Qualcomm, Taiwan's Foxconn Technology and Japan's Sharp Corp. The new fund made its announcement during the visit of President Donald Trump to Riyadh and the signing of tens of billions of dollars worth of business deals between U.S. and Saudi companies. Son was also in Riyadh on Saturday. After meeting with Trump last December, Son pledged $50 billion of investment in the United States that would create 50,000 jobs, a promise Trump claimed was a direct result of his election win. The fund may also serve the interests of Saudi Arabia by helping Riyadh obtain access to foreign technology.

Core commerce revenue surged 47 percent to 31.57 billion yuan with the business delivering operating income of 16.5 billion yuan, the company said. While cloud unit revenue doubled in the March quarter to 2.2 billion yuan, the business had an operating loss of 505 million yuan as it slashes prices to snatch market share from Amazon.com Inc. and Tencent.

       " 'Walmart Reports 63% Rise in Online Sales: On Thursday, the company said e-commerce sales had grown 63 percent in the United States in the latest quarter. The unexpected leap offered the strongest evidence yet that Walmart, the country s largest retailer, is making headway in its effort to be as prominent online as it is across the American landscape. Walmart s latest strategy, put in place by its current chief executive, Doug McMillon, has several parts: expand the number of products available online, better leverage its huge physical warehouses and distribution centers to reach customers quickly across the country, and aggressively pursue deals for online stores. The biggest of those deals, in which Walmart paid $3.3 billion for the bulk e-commerce retailer Jet.com last year, was part of the plan to offer customers more products through the web. The earnings results on Thursday gave only hints of about how much the acquisitions gave the company a one-time bump in sales, rather than long-lasting fruit from other changes the company has made. Comparable-store sales, one measure of growth that looks at stores that have been open for at least a year, rose 1.4 percent. That number includes Walmart s core online business, but not items sold through Jet.com. Walmart completed its purchase of Jet in September. Smaller digital acquisitions followed, including ModCloth, a women s clothing retailer, and the outdoor apparel site Moosejaw. The deal for Jet was also widely seen as a play for its founder, Marc Lore, a serial digital entrepreneur who could help fix Walmart s online strategy. Mr. Lore was put in charge of running Walmart.com after the acquisition, spearheading the face-off between the world s largest brick-and-mortar retailer and its biggest online competitor.',\n",

       " \"Square Will Replace Meters in Washington Taxis: Washington, D.C., is enlisting Square Inc. s help as its taxi commission tries to help the city s cabbies compete with Uber drivers. By the end of August, all of the taxis in Washington have to tear out their traditional meters and start using smartphones or tablets, in what the city government has been describing as a complete reimagining of how the cab system works. For Square, the deal reflects an increasing focus on becoming the payment platform for a range of other company's mobile applications, websites and point-of-sale devices. No money is changing hands between the company and the city. Square agreed to satisfy the department s requirement that drivers give up no more than 2.65 percent of their fares in transaction fees, according to the department. That s lower than the standard 2.75 commission it usually takes and significantly less than the 3.5 percent to 5 percent commission that drivers currently pay to use the mechanical meters, according to Ernest Chrappah, the director of the city's taxi regulator.  Chrappah said the lower fees will help make it easier for cabbies to sustain themselves. But the bigger changes come in the increased flexibility that taxi drivers will have once they re untethered from mechanical meters. There won t be a single taxi app. Instead, the department is asking developers to build apps, which it will then certify for use by licensed taxi drivers. It is currently working with seven developers, who will make their apps public between now the deadline to replace the meters. It will continue to consider adding new apps as developers pitch them. All of the certified apps must be able to operate as meters for street hails. They ll also be able to provide digital receipts showing the route they took and give riders the option to rate drivers. Developers can also build services like carpooling or delivery systems that will connect drivers to local merchants looking for people to drop off food, groceries or other products. A developer could build an Uber clone, creating a way to connect drivers to passengers requesting rides through an app. The exact contours of these services will become clear as the individual developers release their software. Taxis will also be able to offer dynamic pricing, where drivers can give discounts during periods when they have trouble securing fares. This resembles Uber s practice of charging more when demand rises as a way to coax drivers onto the road, only in reverse. Drivers won t have the option to increase their fares.\",\n",
       " 'As self-driving cars hit the road, real estate development may take new direction: The much-hyped transition to autonomous cars, while still years, or even decades, away, according to experts, is an opportunity and challenge that has wide potential to reshape our transportation systems. But many believe that as city planners, transportation officials, and, eventually, developers start grappling with the changes to come, autonomous vehicles  potential to reshape real estate, development, and city planning will rival that of the introduction of the automobile. At the American Planning Association s annual conference earlier this month in New York City, the issue of autonomous vehicles and driverless cars, one admittedly far in the future, was the subject of numerous present-day panels, discussions, and debates. [An expert] sees two small but significant changes affecting urban real estate development in the age of driverless cars. A reduced need for parking may be the most significant. High-value property in urban areas needs to account for mandatory parking allowances, forcing developers to factor the cost of parking spaces into construction costs and rent. Local government will need to act decisively to regulate drop-off lanes, speeds, and new parking rules before market forces, and other governments, begin making decisions for them. Technology firms shouldn t reap the rewards after cities make the investments necessary to adapt to a new transportation reality.',\n",
       " 'Uber Engineer Barred From Work on Key Self-Driving Technology, Judge Says: Uber, the ride-hailing company, sidestepped a full shutdown of its self-driving car efforts on Monday when a federal judge stopped short of issuing a temporary injunction against the program. But the court mandated that Anthony Levandowski, a star engineer leading the program, be prohibited from working on a critical component of autonomous vehicle technology for the duration of the litigation, a setback that could hamper Uber s development efforts. The decision was in a case that has underlined the increasingly bitter fight between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car business that operates under Google s parent company. The companies have been competing in the development of autonomous vehicles, which many consider the future of transportation. The outcome of the case may affect who wins or loses in the technology, which has also drawn other tech companies, automakers and start-ups. In the ruling on Monday, Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco, said,  Waymo L.L.C. has shown compelling evidence that its former star engineer, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded over 14,000 confidential files from Waymo immediately before leaving his employment there.  He added,  Significantly, the evidence indicates that, during the acquisition, Uber likely knew or at least should have known that Levandowski had taken and retained possession of Waymo s confidential files.  Judge Alsup also ruled that Waymo significantly  overreached  when it asked for protection on more than 120 patents it called trade secrets.  General approaches dictated by well-known principles of physics, however, are not  secret,  since they consist essentially of general engineering principles that are simply part of the intellectual equipment of technical employees,  Judge Alsup wrote. He directed Uber to produce a timeline of the events leading to Mr. Levandowski s hiring, including all oral and written discussions between the parties about an important self-driving technology called lidar, short for light detection and ranging, which Mr. Levandowski has been accused of stealing. The judge also ordered Uber to do what it could to ensure the return of the files to Waymo, including the possibility of terminating Mr. Levandowski s employment at Uber.Despite the judge s ruling on Mr. Levandowski, Uber also had cause for celebration because its self-driving research program was not shut down, which would have been a more serious blow.',\n",
       " 'Hardly Anyone Paying the Hackers  Because Using Bitcoin Is Hard: An unprecedented cyberattack swept across the globe over the weekend, but so far the majority of victims haven t paid hackers a ransom. After the ransomware began infecting users on Friday, they were given 72 hours to pay $300 in bitcoin -- chosen by the hackers because the crypto currency is harder to track than conventional payments -- or pay twice as much. If they refused to pay after seven days, their computer would be permanently locked -- a serious problem for those who haven t backed up their data. As of early Monday, only about $50,000 had been paid in ransoms, according to Elliptic Enterprises Ltd., a London-based company that tracks illicit use of bitcoin. The company calculated the total based on payments tracked to bitcoin addresses specified in the ransom demands, adding that it expects the total to rise.  Paying a ransom isn t like buying something from Amazon by entering their credit or debit card information. Even though the hackers provided a helpful link for those new to paying in bitcoin, the crypto currency is a black box for most people. \"If you re presented with something that says pay this amount in bitcoin, most people don t know where to start with that,\" said James Smith, the CEO and co-founder of Elliptic. There are several steps. First, a person or business has to obtain the bitcoins by registering with one of the various online exchanges and going through its verification process. After that, money can be deposited into the exchange. For those living in countries that don t have an exchange, including the U.K., money must be converted into another currency. Once the money is deposited on the exchange, the bitcoins can be sent to the address provided by the extortionist. \"It looks like a long garbled string of text,\" Smith said. After the fee is paid, the hackers supposedly free the affected computer. \"A large amount of bitcoin is actually somewhat difficult to source quickly,\" said Alex Sunnarborg, an analyst at bitcoin research company CoinDesk, adding it might take a few days to create an account at a bitcoin brokerage or exchange, connect a bank account, and then receive the bitcoin. One notable difference with this attack is that the perpetrators demanded a relatively small amount of money but from a large number of people, said James Chappell, chief technology officer and co-founder of U.K. security company Digital Shadows. More typically, he said, hackers demand one large ransom to unlock all the infected machines. \"Quite often they re in the thousands rather than the hundreds of dollars,\" he said. \"It is unusual to see this piecemeal approach, computer by computer.\"',\n",
       " 'Extortionists Mount Global Hacking Attack Seeking Ransom: Extortionist hackers who may be using leaked computer exploits from the U.S. National Security Agency infiltrated computers in dozens of countries in a fast-spreading attack that forced British hospitals to turn away patients and breached systems at Spain s Telefonica SA and organizations from Russia to Taiwan. The ransomware used in Friday s cyber-attacks encrypts files and demands that victims pay $300 in bitcoin for them to be decrypted, the latest in a vexing style of security breaches that, at the very least, forces organizations to revert to backup systems to keep critical systems running. The malicious software has infected more than 75,000 computers in 99 countries worldwide on Friday, most of them concentrated in Russia, Ukraine and Taiwan, according to Dutch cybersecurity company Avast Software BV. While the victim tally is likely to grow, the ransomware, called WanaCrypt0r, only affects computers that haven t applied Microsoft s two-month-old fix, a reminder that individuals and organizations that don t routinely update their machines are vulnerable. Hospitals are notoriously slow in applying security fixes, in part because of how disruptive it is to take patient-facing equipment and databases offline. That has made them a reliable target of ransomware and identity-theft attacks, and why they routinely fall victim even to random mass attacks.',\n",
       " \"Alphabet s self-driving unit Waymo is teaming up with Lyft: Waymo, the self-driving unit of Google parent company Alphabet, is teaming up with Lyft to work on bringing autonomous vehicle efforts to market, the New York Times reports. Details on what this partnership entails remain a little fuzzy, but sources told Times reporter Mike Isaac the two companies would be working together on pilot projects and product development efforts. That's another way of saying Lyft users in some markets will likely be able to hail a Waymo self-driving car in a limited test sometime down the road. This is not Lyft s only partnership aimed at bringing self-driving technology into the mainstream. Lyft has a partnership with GM, which last year acquired self-driving startup Cruise. Alphabet was also experimenting with its own ride-hailing app   which the company has been using in its first pilot program in Arizona. But it's not likely the company would solely depend on either that app or the ride-matching service Waze, another Alphabet subsidiary, has been experimenting with to give consumers access to self-driving cars. That s largely due to the difficulty of gaining market share in the already crowded ride-hail industry   an issue Lyft, the perennial runner up to Uber, knows all too well. The relationship between Uber and Alphabet has gone from tense to combative in the past year. It was long-rumored that the two players would work together on an network of autonomous cars but Uber decided to navigate that road on its own making a competitor of Alphabet as both companies vyed for automaker partnerships. This is just the latest in a series of blows to Uber s and Waymo s once potentially fruitful relationship.\",\n",

       " 'How Australia Bungled Its $36 Billion High-Speed Internet Rollout: Australia, a wealthy nation with a widely envied quality of life, lags in one essential area of modern life: its internet speed. Eight years after the country began an unprecedented broadband modernization effort that will cost at least 49 billion Australian dollars, or $36 billion, its average internet speed lags that of the United States, most of Western Europe, Japan and South Korea. In the most recent ranking of internet speeds by Akamai, a networking company, Australia came in at an embarrassing No. 51, trailing developing economies like Thailand and Kenya. Australia was the first country where a totally national plan to cover every house or business was considered,  said Rod Tucker, a University of Melbourne professor and a member of the expert panel that advised on the effort.  The fact it was a government plan didn t necessarily make it doomed. In Australia, we have changes of governments every three years, which really works against the ability to undertake long-term planning, and the long-term rollouts of networks like this.  Australia poses natural connectivity challenges. It lies oceans away from other countries, and any network would have to connect far-flung cities separated by its sparsely populated interior.Still, Australia had high hopes for its ambitious internet project. Started in 2009, the initiative, known as the National Broadband Network, was intended to bring advanced fiber-optic technology to the doorstep of just about every home and business. It was initially estimated to cost 43 billion Australian dollars, shared by the government and the private sector. But the government share of those costs quickly climbed until taxpayers were responsible for all of it. The technology was slow to roll out, in part because of negotiations with Telstra, Australia s big telecommunications provider, over installing the fiber. (A Telstra spokesman said the company did not believe the talks added to delays.) The government-funded effort drew fire from the Liberal Party, the opposition at the time, which said the job should have been left to the private sector. After a Liberal-led coalition was elected in 2013, that party looked for ways to contain costs and speed up the rollout. They focused on what in the telecommunications industry is called  the last mile    the wires that connect a home or business with the broader network. While the National Broadband Network initially envisioned high-speed fiber connecting homes and businesses directly to the network, the Liberal-led effort compromised by connecting them with existing copper wire   basically, the same technology used in the earliest days of the telephone. The result, critics say, was slow speeds that still did not stop rising costs.',\n",
       " 'The Risk in Using a Public Phone Charger: Can a phone really get hacked by plugging it into a public USB charging station  A. If you have ever backed up your phone s contents by plugging into the computer, you have seen how the USB port can transfer data as well as charge the device s battery. The concept of  juice-jacking  has been proved at hacker conventions and seen in the wild, and it is definitely possible to transfer malicious software with a phone through a USB connection   perhaps from a computer or device concealed within a public charging station, like those found in airports or malls. If you are traveling and are concerned about keeping your phone s battery charged, bring your own USB cable and AC adapter so you can plug right into a regular power outlet. The Wirecutter, a product-recommendation site owned by The Times, has suggestions for USB battery packs to bring along when you expect to be away from an outlet for long periods of time. Other solutions for protecting your phone include taking (or making) a power-only USB cable that lacks the internal wiring needed to transfer data. If you do not have one of those cables, power off the device before you plug it into a public charging port (although this is not a foolproof solution for every phone model out there). Last year, the Federal Trade Commission warned consumers against connecting a personal smartphone to the entertainment system through a USB port or Bluetooth wireless link in a rental car. This is because the dashboard software can import and store data from your phone, like your call logs, messages, contacts and locations you requested from the GPS software.',\n",

The stock fell to $17.66, only just above its IPO price of $17.Snap\\'s revenue jumped nearly four-fold year-over-year to $149.6 million but fell short of the average analyst forecast of $158 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue was also down from the fourth quarter of 2016, a seasonally stronger period for ad sales, when it was $166 million. Revenue was \"a relatively disappointing number,\" Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser said. \"To their credit,\" he added, \"they did guide towards a number that would be lower, which it was.\" Average revenue per user was 90 cents in the first quarter, Snap said, up from 33 cents the same quarter a year earlier but below the $1.05 per user in the fourth quarter of 2016. Snap\\'s net loss widened to $2.21 billion, or $2.31 per share, in the first quarter, from $104.6 million, or 14 cents per share, due to stock-based compensation related to the IPO.Although the figure of $2 billion in total stock-based compensation was known ahead of time, investors were surprised to see all of it show up in a single quarter rather than spread out over time, said Eric Kim, managing partner at Goodwater Capital. \"It is an eye-popping number for sure,\" he said.',\n",
       " 'As Department Stores Close, Stitch Fix Expands Online: The retail landscape is littered with the casualties of changing consumer behavior. Shoppers are bargain hunting online, department stores are struggling, and once-mainstay brands are closing out permanently. Then there is Stitch Fix, a mail-order clothing service that offers customers little choice in what garments they receive, and shies away from discounts for brand name dresses, pants and accessories. Despite a business model that seems to defy conventional wisdom, Stitch Fix continues to grow. For the fiscal year that ended last July, the company recorded sales of $730 million. It has been profitable since 2014 and has raised just $42 million from outside investors, a relatively modest sum for a high-flying Silicon Valley start-up. Stitch Fix s pitch is straightforward enough: Trust the company to pick out your tops, bottoms, shoes or accessories for you. When customers sign up, they fill out an extensive form detailing style preferences, clothing needs and price points. The start-up s algorithms then churn out a set of potential choices, which one of its 3,400 stylists   most of them part time   then tailors to the individual customer before sending out five items in a package. Anything a customer does not want can be returned free of charge, and customers receive a 25 percent discount when they buy everything in the box. Stitch Fix is not the first company to try this business model. Similar start-ups, from clothing rival Trunk Club to the cosmetics specialist Birchbox, have found a market mailing consumers a grab bag of items and offering free returns for anything unwanted. But many such start-ups have had trouble keeping costs down, and customers around. Nordstrom, which bought Trunk Club in 2014 for a reported $350 million, wrote down nearly $200 million from the business  value last year.',\n",

In the fourth quarter (reported in February), Yelp said net revenue was expected to be in the range of $880 million to $900 million. That means even though the company s revenue fell only a little short of what Wall Street was expecting, the company is signaling slower growth than expected. Yelp has seen slowing revenue growth for some time now.

The e-commerce giant's Amazon Echo and Echo Dot devices will claim a 70.6 percent share of the U.S. market this year, the study found. The speakers feature Alexa, Amazon's voice-controlled aide, which users can tell to play music, order an Uber or turn on the house lights. That puts it far ahead of Alphabet Inc's Google Home, a similar gadget that has a 23.8 percent share, and less successful offerings from other tech companies. The number of active U.S. users will more than double for the devices this year, to 35.6 million, eMarketer said. The report underscores Amazon's progress in making Alexa and its speech-recognition technology an integral part of customers' lives. More users means more data that can improve Alexa's understanding and could make it a top platform for voice, like Windows is for desktop. Amazon does not disclose Echo sales figures but has said it had trouble keeping the product in stock. Device sales and extra revenue from shoppers placing orders via Alexa could generate $10 billion for Amazon by 2020, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said in a recent note. And that does not include potential revenue from others using Alexa as a platform. Google's share is expected to grow, though. Tests by analysts have shown the technology underpinning the Google Home to match or be superior to competitors. A survey by Mahaney found the device's brand awareness in the United States already equaled 80 percent of Alexa's, despite being on the market for fewer months.\",\n",

He had a Ouija board in his lap and was livestreaming the experience to a group of fans on YouTube.  You re not ever supposed to do Ouija alone, let alone in a place that had an exorcism done in it,  he said to the empty room. As he filmed last month, the comments rolled in, some admiring ( You are one brave ghost hunter ), others fearing for his safety ( Tim, don t summon what u can t banish ). Mr. Wood, 39, has amassed a small but loyal following by making online videos of ghost hunts and paranormal activity, using YouTube to broadcast his work since about 2013. Automatically placed advertisements on his channel, LiveScifi, which has about 470,000 subscribers, have allowed him to turn the videos into a full-time job.But in the wake of a recent advertiser exodus from YouTube, prompted by major brands discovering they were showing up on videos promoting hate speech and terrorism, his earnings have plunged. Mr. Wood, who lives in San Francisco with his fianc e and their infant, said his channel had brought in at least $6,000 a month in revenue last year   which helped pay for travel to site locations, the production of his videos and his other day-to-day bills. In January, his estimated revenue was about $3,900. In February and March, he was alarmed to see that drop below $3,000. Last month, he saw around $1,600 and has been using crowdfunding to cover his shooting costs.In February and March, a slew of advertisers yanked their money from the platform, prompting YouTube to tighten its default settings for where ads appear and to offer new ways for brands to manually and automatically avoid material that violates its guidelines.

Munger said Saturday that avoiding Silicon Valley investments made sense for the pair, with some exceptions.  We avoided the tech stocks because we felt we had no advantage there, and other people did. And I think that s a good idea not to play where the other people are better,  Munger said.

Given the price that Geico was paying per click, Buffett said, he should have seen the technology company s promise.

The system will recommend ways to save an at-risk deal, like calling in a co-worker who is connected to the potential customer on LinkedIn. The enhancements, which will be available this summer, will require Microsoft Dynamics customers to also be LinkedIn customers. The artificial intelligence, or AI, capabilities of the software would be central, Nadella said. \"I want to be able to democratize AI so that any customer using these products is able to, in fact, take their own data and load it into AI for themselves,\" he said. While Microsoft is a behemoth in the market for operating systems and productivity software like Office, it is a small player in sales software. The company ranks fourth - far behind Salesforce.com and other rivals Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) and SAP (SAPG.DE) - with just 4.3 percent of the market in 2015, the most recent year for which figures are available, according to research firm Gartner.Nadella is under pressure to show that the pricey LinkedIn acquisition in mid-2016 was worthwhile.

       " \"Tesla s big Model 3 bet rides on risky assembly line strategy: Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk took many risks with the technology in his company's cars on the way to surpassing Ford Motor Co's market value. Now Musk is pushing boundaries in the factory that makes them. Most automakers test a new model's production line by building vehicles with relatively cheap, prototype tools designed to be scrapped once they deliver doors that fit, body panels with the right shape and dashboards that don't have gaps or seams. Tesla, however, is skipping that preliminary step and ordering permanent, more expensive equipment as it races to launch its Model 3 sedan by a self-imposed volume production deadline of September, Musk told investors last month. Musk s decision underscores his high-risk tolerance and willingness to forego long-held industry norms that has helped Tesla upend the traditional auto industry. While Tesla is not the first automaker to try to accelerate production on the factory floor, no other rival is putting this much faith in the production strategy succeeding.\",\n",
       " 'Virtual Reality Companies Navigate  The Trough of Disillusionment : Twelve months ago the Virtual Reality World Congress in Bristol, England, was a sell-out show, with over 750 attendees gawping over the latest VR hardware and production techniques. This year\\'s event, which took place last week, attracted even more participants -- more than 1,200 over three days -- but the mood felt decidedly less upbeat. Virtual reality, it seems, has been mugged by reality. Sales of VR hardware have fallen 40 percent behind forecasts, CCS Insight, a technology research group, said in a February report. And the VR hardware that is selling has mostly been relatively inexpensive goggles that allow people to experience VR through their smartphones, such as Samsung\\'s Gear VR and Google\\'s Daydream, not higher-end, dedicated headsets such as those made by Sony Corp, Facebook Inc.\\'s Oculus and HTC Corp. Many working in VR have run up against the hard economic reality of trying to produce content for a technology that remains, at least for the moment, fairly niche. As disappointment is setting in for virtual reality, expectations are building around its less glamorous cousin, augmented reality, which is also sometimes called mixed reality because it places digitally-rendered elements in the real observed environment. In 2016, Pokemon Go, which is an augmented reality game played on smartphones, became a worldwide phenomenon. Microsoft launched its high-end AR headset, HoloLens, which has found customers mostly among industrial and business users -- such as aeronautical engineers and architects. Snap Inc.\\'s AR photo filters are one of the most popular features of its messaging service and Facebook has announced a big push into the field with its own AR camera filters.  Many now expect Apple Inc. to introduce an augmented reality product in the next year, which might help AR to leapfrog VR to achieve mass adoption. Technology company ABI Research says that virtual reality currently generates about 50 percent more revenue than augmented reality but that it relies heavily on hardware sales. Augmented reality, by contrast, relies more on software and in many cases can be experienced by users with their existing smartphones. ABI forecasts that AR revenues will surpass VR sales by 2019. Virtual reality true believers, like Taylor, are dismissive of the idea that AR might outrun VR as a blockbuster consumer technology. Augmented reality requires too much training for the average consumer to learn how to integrate the digital images into the real world, Taylor said. \"Mixing the virtual world and the real world is less natural,\" he said. Simply popping on a headset and diving into a completely virtual environment is, somewhat counter-intuitively, easier, he said. ABI Research still forecasts that virtual reality device shipments will reach 110 million units by 2021 -- huge growth considering only about 6.3 million such devices were shipped last year, according to tech research company Super Data.

It was a session that Mr. Kalanick was dreading. For months, Mr. Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app from Apple s engineers. The reason  So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased   a fraud detection maneuver that violated Apple s privacy guidelines.  But Apple was onto the deception, and when Mr. Kalanick arrived at the midafternoon meeting sporting his favorite pair of bright red sneakers and hot-pink socks, Mr. Cook was prepared.  So, I ve heard you ve been breaking some of our rules,  Mr. Cook said in his calm, Southern tone. Stop the trickery, Mr. Cook then demanded, or Uber s app would be kicked out of Apple s App Store. For Mr. Kalanick, the moment was fraught with tension. If Uber s app was yanked from the App Store, it would lose access to millions of iPhone customers   essentially destroying the ride-hailing company s business. So Mr. Kalanick acceded. In a quest to build Uber into the world s dominant ride-hailing entity, Mr. Kalanick has openly disregarded many rules and norms, backing down only when caught or cornered. He has flouted transportation and safety regulations, bucked against entrenched competitors and capitalized on legal loopholes and gray areas to gain a business advantage. In the process, Mr. Kalanick has helped create a new transportation industry, with Uber spreading to more than 70 countries and gaining a valuation of nearly $70 billion, and its business continues to grow. But the previously unreported encounter with Mr. Cook showed how Mr. Kalanick was also responsible for risk-taking that pushed Uber beyond the pale, sometimes to the very brink of implosion. Crossing that line was not a one-off for Mr. Kalanick. According to interviews with more than 50 current and former Uber employees, investors and others with whom the executive had personal relationships, Mr. Kalanick, 40, is driven to the point that he must win at whatever he puts his mind to and at whatever cost   a trait that has now plunged Uber into its most sustained set of crises since its founding in 2009.',\n",

A lot of prototypes have been showcased recently, and a lot of money is being tossed around. More people than ever seem to buy into the crazy notion that in the near future we ll be buzzing between rooftops in private, autonomous drones. Today, Munich-based Lilium Aviation announced an important milestone: the first test flight of its all-electric, two-seater, vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) prototype. In a video provided by the Munich-based startup, the aircraft can be seen taking off vertically like a helicopter, and then accelerating into forward flight using wing-borne lift. The craft is powered by 36 separate jet engines mounted on its 10-meter long wings via 12 movable flaps. At take-off, the flaps are pointed downwards to provide vertical lift. And once airborne, the flaps gradually tilt into a horizontal position, providing forward thrust. During the tests, the jet was piloted remotely, but its operators say their first manned flight is close-at-hand. And Lilium claims that its electric battery  consumes around 90 percent less energy than drone-style aircraft,  enabling the aircraft to achieve a range of 300 kilometers (183 miles) with a maximum cruising speed of 300 kph (183 mph).',\n",

The complaint filed on Tuesday by Kyle Zak in federal court in Chicago seeks an injunction to stop Bose\\'s \"wholesale disregard\" for the privacy of customers who download its free Bose Connect app from Apple Inc or Google Play stores to their smartphones. Zak\\'s lawsuit was the latest to accuse companies of trying to boost profit by quietly amassing customer information, and then selling it or using it to solicit more business. After paying $350 for his QuietComfort 35 headphones, Zak said he took Bose\\'s suggestion to \"get the most out of your headphones\" by downloading its app, and providing his name, email address and headphone serial number in the process. But the Illinois resident said he was surprised to learn that Bose sent \"all available media information\" from his smartphone to third parties such as Segment.io, whose website promises to collect customer data and \"send it anywhere.\" Audio choices offer \"an incredible amount of insight\" into customers\\' personalities, behavior, politics and religious views, citing as an example that a person who listens to Muslim prayers might \"very likely\" be a Muslim, the complaint said.

The product was an unlikely pick for top technology investors, but they were drawn to the idea of an internet-connected device that transforms single-serving packets of chopped fruits and vegetables into a refreshing and healthy beverage. Doug Evans, the company s founder, would compare himself with Steve Jobs in his pursuit of juicing perfection. He declared that his juice press wields four tons of force  enough to lift two Teslas,  he said. Google s venture capital arm and other backers poured about $120 million into the startup. Juicero sells the machine for $400, plus the cost of individual juice packs delivered weekly. Tech blogs have dubbed it a  Keurig for juice. But after the product hit the market, some investors were surprised to discover a much cheaper alternative: You can squeeze the Juicero bags with your bare hands. Two backers said the final device was bulkier than what was originally pitched and that they were puzzled to find that customers could achieve similar results without it. Bloomberg performed its own press test, pitting a Juicero machine against a reporter s grip. The experiment found that squeezing the bag yields nearly the same amount of juice just as quickly and in some cases, faster than using the device.',\n",

The technology is similar to the augmented reality used with Pokemon Go, a Nintendo game for mobile devices that overlays digital images on the physical world. Snap s new technology, a 3-D lens, can also change and shift in response to physical objects. Snap said in a blog post that it launched lenses   which are images that people can superimpose on their selfies   a year and a half ago to give users more ways to express themselves. These features added whimsy and color to Snapchat s messaging service, which has drawn an avid base of users and has helped propel new forms of digital advertising. Partly powered by Snapchat s fan base and advertising business, Snap went public last month. But the company s stock has fallen as Facebook and its many brands have copied the features that once made Snapchat unique. Instagram, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Facebook all now have a feature that mimics Snapchat Stories, which lets people string together their images in an ongoing story that disappears after 24 hours.

       " 'Batteries could be Tesla s secret weapon: Markets are very optimistic about Tesla s future   so optimistic that it would be impossible to explain if Tesla were a conventional car company. On paper, Tesla shouldn t be worth anywhere near as much as rivals like Ford and GM. Ford sold 6.6 million cars in 2016. GM sold 10 million. Tesla sold a paltry 76,000. Ford and GM both turned healthy profits in 2016. Tesla lost money. Yet earlier this month Tesla s market value surged past Ford and then briefly eclipsed GM as America s most valuable carmaker. One big reason for this is that Tesla has made a risky bet on batteries that could be on the verge of a huge payoff. Because Tesla cars are purely electric, a single car needs about 1,000 times as much battery capacity as a typical smartphone. So making electric cars a mainstream technology will require producing batteries on a scale that dwarfs today s production for smartphones and other portable gadgets. A major test of this will come in Tesla s release of the Model 3 later this year. These cars will be powered by batteries from the Gigafactory, a huge factory Tesla has constructed in the Nevada desert. If the Model 3 is a hit, experts say, the Gigafactory will ensure Tesla has plenty of batteries to meet demand for this relatively affordable mass-market vehicle. Other car companies would have to scramble   not only to design a similar stylish vehicle, but also to find suppliers for yet more batteries. Experts say this battery advantage won t last forever   other battery makers might be able to catch up within a year or two. But having a year or two head start could make a big difference   not only cementing Tesla s reputation as the leading electric car brand, but positioning Tesla to make further investments that could help it stay a step ahead of rivals down the road.',\n",

This target appears to have done more harm than good: analysts continue to rate the company using it as a metric; and people in the know attribute the departure of at least a few senior executives over the past few years to it. Now, an analyst at a foreign brokerage has suggested that the company is better off without the target.  Management continues to maintain  aspirational  revenue and margin targets that are increasingly becoming unlikely to be achieved, in our opinion. Given Infy (Infosys) is now guiding to lower levels of both revenue growth and margins in FY18 (2017-18), we think management would be well-served to either amend or drop its aspirational targets,  Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 16 April. Since outlining this target, Sikka steered Infosys to dollar revenue growth of 9.1% in 2015-16 and 7.4% in 2016-17; for the second consecutive year, Infosys will grow faster than its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and cross-town peer Wipro Ltd (Wipro). Still, Infosys continues to be evaluated on the progress it makes in becoming a $20 billion company. Worryingly for the management, a bigger fallout of the targets has been the pressure on senior leaders, making a few of them leave. Since April 2015, half-a-dozen executive vice-presidents (EVPs) and a dozen senior vice-presidents (SVPs) have quit. Not all departures are on account of the targets but two former executives admit that they left Infosys as they could not keep up with the  impossible targets. ',\n",

       " 'Nintendo Shares Jump After Switch Sets U.S. Sales Records: Nintendo Co. shares jumped as much as 4 percent after the company said its new Switch console is off to a record-setting pace in the U.S. since its March 3 debut. The new device sold 906,000 units in North America during March, according to industry researcher NPD Group. That means the gaming machine  sold faster in its launch month than any other video game system in Nintendo history,  according to Nintendo. The Switch has received praise for its console-tablet hybrid design that lets gamers play both in the living room and outside the house. While its limited software lineup and limited graphics ability have been criticized, demand has consistently outstripped supply during the first six weeks of sales. That s buoyed investors who think the Switch is on track to become a bigger hit than the Wii, the company s best-selling home console of all-time.',\n",
       " 'Burger King debuts Whopper ad that triggers Google Home devices: Fast-food chain Burger King said on Wednesday it will start televising a commercial for its signature Whopper sandwich that is designed to activate Google voice-controlled devices, raising questions about whether marketing tactics have become too invasive. The 15-second ad starts with a Burger King employee holding up the sandwich saying, \"You\\'re watching a 15-second Burger King ad, which is unfortunately not enough time to explain all the fresh ingredients in the Whopper sandwich. But I\\'ve got an idea. OK, Google, what is the Whopper burger \" If a viewer has the Google Home assistant or an Android phone with voice search enabled within listening range of the TV, that last phrase - \"Hello Google, what is the Whopper burger \" - is intended to trigger the device to search for Whopper on Google and read out the finding from Wikipedia.',\n",
       " 'Google Home has stopped answering to that annoying Burger King ad: The internet barely had time to be annoyed for that new 15 second Burger King ad before Google shut the whole thing down. A little over two hours after the fast food giant took the wraps off of a TV spot designed to trigger smart assistants across the country, the functionality no longer works. We ve reached out to Google for confirmation of the action, which was likely just a quick fix on the server side designed to block a specific waveform, perhaps leveraging similar functionality to block out its own ads. Meantime, we ve tried in out on a Home unit we have around the office and can confirm that the commercial no longer has the intended effect. Interestingly, it s not the specific function, just the voice from the ad. Asking Home what a  Whopper sandwich  is in your own voice (like a Big Mac, but smaller) will bring up the Wikipedia entry as initially intended. For Google, the fix is likely akin to patching a security flaw (though here it s more about annoyance than any real security threat).',\n",

The two companies had agreed to enter binding arbitration to settle claims by BlackBerry that it was owed refunds on technology licensing fees prepaid to the chipmaker. The announcement sent BlackBerry shares up as much as 19 percent in New York, the most intraday since January 2015. The refund from Qualcomm will boost BlackBerry s cash hoard, which stood at $1.7 billion at the end of its fiscal fourth quarter, helping Chief Executive Officer John Chen as he spends more money to shift the company s focus to software and security-focused products.

The e-commerce giant considered internally whether Whole Foods would help invigorate its nearly decadelong push into groceries, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations were private. The discussions never turned into a concrete plan, according to the person. Though Whole Foods has long been seen as a buyout target, activist investor Jana Partners LLC set off a new wave of speculation this week when it acquired a stake and urged the company to evaluate a sale. With a market valuation of $10.7 billion, the ailing organic-food retailer would be an outsized acquisition for Amazon -- dwarfing its 2009 purchase of online shoe retailer Zappos for about $1.2 billion. But the deal would turn Amazon into a grocery giant overnight and help it sideline Instacart Inc., a startup that delivers grocery orders from Whole Foods stores in more than 20 states and Washington, D.C. Shares of Whole Foods jumped as much as 5.8 percent to $35.50 in late trading after Bloomberg reported on the Amazon discussions.

       " 'Qualcomm sues Apple for hobbling its iPhone chips to make Intel look better: After Apple hit Qualcomm with a barrage of lawsuits earlier this year, the chipmaker is countersuing Apple right back. Qualcomm today filed its Answers and Counterclaims to Apple s January lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of California. The full details of the suit can be read in a 139-page document (PDF) released by Qualcomm, but the company has five key complaints   including the claim that Apple deliberately didn t use the full potential of Qualcomm chips in iPhone 7 phones so that they wouldn t perform better than the modems provided by Intel. Qualcomm says that Apple  chose not to utilize certain high-performance features of the Qualcomm chipsets for the iPhone 7 (preventing consumers from enjoying the full extent of Qualcomm s innovation),  and when Qualcomm iPhones supposedly outperformed Intel iPhones,  Apple falsely claimed that there was  no discernible difference  between  the two variants.The company also says that Apple prevented it from revealing to customers  the extent to which iPhones with Qualcomm s chipsets outperformed iPhones with Intel s chipsets.  As part of its five core arguments, Qualcomm says Apple  threatened  it to keep quiet about the differences between Intel and Qualcomm iPhones, preventing Qualcomm from  making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones.  Other complaints in the countersuit include claims that Apple breached and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm, encouraged attacks on the company in a number of markets by misrepresenting facts and making false statements, and interfered with Qualcomm s existing agreements with other companies. Apple s original suit against Qualcomm was filed in January this year in the United States, and claimed $1 billion from the chipmaker, arguing that it had been drastically overcharging for the use of patents. That was followed up by two additional suits   one in China and one in the United Kingdom   that also focused on patents and designs. A case filed in Beijing claimed 1 billion yuan ($145 million) for Qualcomm s abuse of China s monopoly laws. Tim Cook said that Apple had  no choice  but to sue Qualcomm, even after the two companies had worked together for many years, saying that he and his company  didn t see another way forward.  According to Cook, Qualcomm was  insisting on charging royalties for technologies that they had nothing to do with,  collecting money on features like Apple s TouchID fingerprint readers and cameras.',\n",

       " \"Why Spotify s IPO-less IPO is a smart idea:Here's a smart idea: In a traditional IPO, the company listing the stock sells shares to a bunch of institutional investors, like hedge funds and pension funds, at an  initial offering price.  The next day, those institutional investors sell those shares on an open exchange like the New York Stock Exchange. This is when regular folks can buy shares, but at a higher price than the IPO. That s what generates the  pop,  you always read about on IPO day. The pop also comes since the institutional investors should get a return for the risk they took in the IPO. Let s take a recent, real-world example: Snap sold stock in its IPO last month for $17 a share. That means Snap s early investors, like Benchmark, got $17 for every share they sold. But the next day, when those IPO investors sold shares on the NYSE, the stock traded at $24, a 41 percent pop above the IPO price. Every penny above $17 is a penny Snap and its early investors didn t get. So you could argue the pop was bad for the early owners of Snap. They left 41 percent on the table. So you could see how Spotify CEO Daniel Ek might not want to go through the IPO process. Why give all that money to brokers, instead of people who own Spotify, like his investors, his employees and Ek himself   Instead, by listing directly, Spotify can skip the IPO pricing altogether and just sell shares on an open exchange. The conceit of a direct listing is that it s more democratic, very logical, very internet. You can see the appeal to Ek. But there is a rationale for the IPO process too. By hiring underwriters, a company is  pre-selling  shares to qualified buyers. That assures the company will get something for its shares while also stoking interest in the open market. You might even argue that in the case of Snap s IPO it might not have even gotten $17 a share if they hadn't hired bankers to manage the sale. In effect, the bankers set a price range, then go to the big institutional investors to see where they ll bite before narrowing in on a set price. (Some analysts have pegged $15 as a fair value price for Snap shares.) Underwriters like Goldman Sachs are paid as much as 7 to 8 percent commission for their work, but companies can negotiate that down. In the case of Snap, it was about 2.5 to 3 percent, according to sources.\",\n",

Mr. Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, showed off the reusable rocket booster and the mock-up of the capsule that will take people up for panoramic views back down at earth, during a symposium here. Mr. Bezos, who hopes to build Blue Origin into a commercial and tourist venture, also disclosed that it would cost about $2.5 billion to develop an even bigger rocket, New Glenn, capable of lifting satellites and, eventually, people into orbit. Like his fellow technology titan Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla, Mr. Bezos has identified reusable rocket parts as a key to lowering the price of admission to the field, which he said on Wednesday would lead to a  golden age of space exploration.  Last month, Mr. Bezos announced the first-paying customer, Eutelstat, a satellite company, for New Glenn, whose commercial flights would help offset costs. New Glenn is expected to fly by 2020, he said, but humans will not be passengers on the heavy-lift rocket until many years after that. Mr. Bezos has repeatedly expressed caution about setting timetables for the start of Blue Origin s commercial or passenger trips, and he did not diverge from that on Wednesday. He would not say when New Shepard would undergo its next round of test flights, or set a specific date as a goal, merely mentioning next year for possible tourist trips.',\n",

Customers then asked Apple to fix their devices, only to be told by the company that \"no Apple entity ... was required to, or would, provide a remedy\" for free, the documents added.',\n",
       " \"SoftBank moots Snapdeal sale to Flipkart, proposed deal set to be biggest in Indian e-commerce: SoftBank, the largest shareholder in Snapdeal, held boardroom discussions on the proposed sale of the online marketplace to rival Flipkart on Tuesday, according to two people aware of the development. According to the terms proposed by the Japanese media and telecom conglomerate, Snapdeal shareholders will get one share of Flipkart for every ten they own, said the people cited above. Early investors in Snapdeal   Kalaari Capital and Nexus Venture Partners   have also asked for about $100 million each from the sale, the sources said. The proposed sale could see SoftBank pick up a 20% stake in the country's largest ecommerce company for about $1.5 billion, in the process buying out $500 million to $1 billion worth of Tiger Global's holding in Flipkart, according to two people aware of the matter.  Alibaba-backed Paytm E-commerce has also discussed a potential acquisition of Snapdeal, but the valuation offered was much lower than that offered by Flipkart, added another source.  The meeting signals easing of tensions between Kalaari and Nexus, and SoftBank, said one of the sources mentioned above. \",\n",
       " 'Troubled Chinese Giant LeEco Said to Delay Paying U.S. Employees: Chinese technology conglomerate LeEco Inc. delayed payroll for U.S. employees this month, people familiar with the matter said, another sign that billionaire Jia Yueting s media and Internet empire is grappling with a cash squeeze. LeEco s U.S. employees are normally paid on the 15th and last day of every month, but the company has told employees that March 31 paychecks would be delayed until April 4, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private matters. LeEco told employees in the U.S. the delay was due to issues with moving money from China, according to one of the people. After rapid expansion of his tech empire, Jia admitted late last year that the company was struggling to raise cash. Some suppliers said that LeEco was behind on payments and the company was stripped of some sports broadcasting rights after defaulting. The paycheck delays are stoking frustration at a U.S. operation that s suffered key executive departures in the last few months. Jia said in October that LeEco employs more than 500 people in the country  with more being added each week,  but the company hasn t disclosed its latest U.S. headcount.',\n",
       " 'Apple aims for more control, less cost as it accelerates in chip design: Apple\\'s decision to stop licensing graphics chips from Imagination Technologies Group Plc is the clearest example yet of the iPhone maker\\'s determination to take greater control of the core technologies in its products - both to guard its hefty margins and to position it for future innovations, especially in so-called augmented reality. The strategy, analysts say, has already reduced Apple\\'s dependence on critical outside suppliers like ARM Holdings Plc, now owned by SoftBank Group Corp. Apple once relied heavily on ARM to design the main processor for the iPhone, but it now licenses only the basic ARM architecture and designs most of the chip itself. More recently, when Apple bought the headphone company Beats Electronics, part of a $3 billion deal in 2014, it ripped out the existing, off-the-shelf communications chips and replaced them with its own custom-designed W1 Bluetooth chip. \"Apple clearly got rid of all the conventional suppliers and replaced about five chips with one,\" said Jim Morrison, vice president of TechInsights, a firm that examines the chips inside electronics devices. Most vendors of consumer electronics products rely on outside suppliers for chip design and development, primarily because it is extremely expensive. That has created huge opportunities for companies like ARM, Qualcomm Inc and Nvidia Corp, which have developed core technologies for processing, communications and graphics that are used by scores of vendors. Now, though, Apple is so big that it can economically create its own designs, or license small pieces of others\\' work and build on it. As with ARM and Qualcomm, the actual manufacturing of the chips is still contracted out to a semiconductor foundry, such as those run by Samsung Electronics and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd.',\n",
       " 'Tesla Passes Ford in Market Value as Investors Bet on the Future: The record pace of auto sales in the United States is slowing down, leaving investors increasingly bearish on auto stocks. But there is one exception. Tesla, the electric-vehicle upstart, continues to surge. On Monday, Tesla surpassed Ford Motor in market value for the first time and moved within striking distance of General Motors, starkly illustrating the growing gap in investors  optimism over its future versus the prospects for the traditional carmakers from Detroit. While G.M. and Ford may have strong profits and healthy balance sheets, Tesla offers something Wall Street loves much more: the potential for dramatic growth.  Investors want something that is going to go up in orders of magnitude in six months to six years, and Tesla is that story,  said Karl Brauer, a senior editor at Kelley Blue Book.  Nobody thinks Ford or G.M. is going to do that. At the end of Monday s trading, Tesla reached a market capitalization of $48.7 billion compared with Ford s $45.6 billion, according to Bloomberg. General Motors was at $51.2 billion. Tesla s market milestone came at the intersection of two countervailing trends. On Sunday, Tesla said its first-quarter sales were up 69 percent from the same period a year ago. On Monday, monthly sales figures for the conventional automakers showed them struggling to meet last March s performance.',\n",
       " 'Trump Cracks Down on H-1B Visa Program That Feeds Silicon Valley: The U.S. administration began to deliver on President Donald Trump s campaign promise to crack down on a work visa program that channels thousands of skilled overseas workers to companies across the technology industry. Fed up with a program it says favors foreign workers at the expense of Americans, the Trump administration rolled out a trio of policy shifts. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency on Friday made it harder for companies to bring overseas tech workers to the U.S. using the H-1B work visa. On Monday, the agency issued a memo laying out new measures to combat what it called \"fraud and abuse\" in the program. The Justice Department also warned employers applying for the visas not to discriminate against U.S. workers. The new guidelines released Friday require additional information for computer programmers applying for H-1B visas to prove the jobs are complicated and require more advanced knowledge and experience. It s effective immediately, so it will change how companies apply for the visas in an annual lottery process that begins Monday. The changes don t explicitly prohibit applications for a specific type of job. Instead, they bring more scrutiny to those for computer programmers doing the simplest jobs.',\n",
       " 'Cloudera s IPO will test unicorn valuations: Cloudera filed to go public mid-day last Friday, releasing a set of financial numbers that were the locus of anticipation: How would the company s recent performance stack up to its $4.1 billion valuation set three years ago  Before Cloudera published its S-1 document   detailing its recent quarterly results and several years of financial data   reports indicated that the company would pursue a $4.1 billion valuation in its IPO, flat from its last private round when Intel poured $740 million into the company. That Cloudera might aim for a level valuation with a dozen or so quarters of additional growth under its belt was notable. (Crunchbase News reached out to Cloudera regarding the valuation figure. The company declined to comment.) The situation raises an obvious question: Did Cloudera s investors incorrectly estimate the potential future value of the company in 2014 if it intends to secure a flat valuation today  It is likely fair to say that Cloudera s investors were at least partially incorrect about where the company s value would end up by the first quarter of 2017. No one alive deploys three-quarters of a billion dollars in capital for a flat return over a multi-year period. And doubly, Cloudera may in fact still be overvalued at the proposed $4.1 billion valuation when compared to certain public market comps.',\n",
       " 'Dyson Is the Apple of Appliances (and Just as Secretive): When Michael Aldred joined the British home electronics maker Dyson two decades ago, he had a simple goal: to quickly build a robotic vacuum cleaner. But Mr. Aldred and his team kept running into roadblocks. Their first attempt, unveiled in 2001, was too clunky for James Dyson, the company s founder. The next prototype involved creating a computer vision system that would allow the machine to skirt independently around furniture; it took more than a decade to perfect. As smartphones became everyday tools, Dyson s robotics team again had to rethink the vacuum cleaner, adding internet connectivity so the machine could send notifications   with a heat map of where it had cleaned   to a mobile device. After a nearly 20-year odyssey, the robot cleaner, priced at an eye-watering $1,000, finally hit stores worldwide last year.  At times, I really asked myself what I had signed up for,  Mr. Aldred said in an interview at Dyson s rural headquarters near the border with Wales.  But James Dyson always told us to focus on the product. Everything else would follow.  Not many consumer electronics brands would spend almost two decades   and tens of millions of dollars   building a vacuum cleaner that retails for more than a top-of-the-line laptop. But combining an almost obsessive eye for design and engineering, the privately held Dyson has cornered the nonglamorous market of high-end vacuum cleaners, lights and hair dryers   and in the process bucked the technology truism that companies rarely make money in the difficult arena of hardware. Even as other hardware brands like Samsung, the smartwatch maker Fitbit and the camera designer GoPro have struggled with physical products because of low-priced copycats and thin profit margins, Dyson has shown an uncanny ability to mint money. Its latest robot cleaner, which is selling briskly, exemplifies that and puts Dyson in rarefied company alongside Apple as one of the few tech companies worldwide to consistently profit from consumer gadgets.',\n",
       " 'Why do developers who could work anywhere flock to the world s most expensive cities  I believe there s a more fundamental economic divide opening than the one between haves and have-nots. I think we are witnessing a growing rift between the world s Extremistan cities, in which truly extraordinary things can be achieved, and its Mediocristan towns, in which you van work and make money and be happy but never achieve greatness. (Labels stolen from the great Nassim Taleb) The arts have long had Extremistan cities. That s why aspiring writers move to New York City, and even directors and actors who found international success are still drawn to L.A. like moths to a klieg light. Now it is true of tech too. Even if you don t even want to try to (help) build something extraordinary   and the startup myth is so powerful today that it s a very rare engineer indeed who hasn t at least dreamed about it   the prospect of being where great things happen is intoxicatingly enticing. But the interesting thing about this is that it could, in theory, change; because   as of quite recently   distributed, decentralized teams can, in fact, achieve extraordinary things. The cards are arguably stacked against them, because VCs tend to be quite myopic. But no law dictates that unicorns may only be born in California, and a handful of other secondary territories; and it seems likely that, for better or worse, Extremistan is spreading. It would be pleasantly paradoxical if that expansion ultimately leads to lower rents in the Mission.',\n",

That may finally change, if the people in charge of Silicon Valley   venture capitalists, who control the money   start to realize that the real problem with tech bros is not just that they re boorish jerks. It s that they re boorish jerks who don t know how to run companies. Look at Uber, the ride-hailing start-up. It s the biggest tech unicorn in the world, with a valuation of $69 billion. Not long ago Uber seemed invincible. Now it s in free fall, and top executives have fled. The company s woes spring entirely from its toxic bro culture, created by its chief executive, Travis Kalanick. Bro cos. become corporate frat houses, where employees are chosen like pledges, based on  culture fit.  Women get hired, but they rarely get promoted and sometimes complain of being harassed. Minorities and older workers are excluded. Bro culture also values speedy growth over sustainable profits, and encourages cutting corners, ignoring regulations and doing whatever it takes to win. Sometimes it works. But often the whole thing just flames out. The bros blow through the money and find they have no viable business. For example: Quirky, founded in 2009 by the 20-something Ben Kaufman.

       " 'YouTube creators have complained about declines in ad revenue: Some YouTube creators might get less money from Google, at least temporarily, as the company adds new controls for advertisers in the wake of an ad controversy that erupted two weeks ago. A number of big-name advertisers suspended ads on YouTube last week and the week before after discovering their ads were making money for videos containing hate speech or supporting terrorism. Google has responded by promising greater transparency and saying it will be more aggressive in ensuring brand safety of ad placements.  If you re seeing fluctuations in your revenue over the next few weeks, it may be because we re fine tuning our ads systems to address these concerns,  reads a YouTube community manager post from Thursday. The changes stem from tweaks to the ads system, rather than any revenue loss that might have come after advertisers pulled their business, according to a source close to the situation. YouTube could lose $750 million in revenue this year over advertisers halting business, according to analyst firm Nomura Instinet. Some YouTube creators appear to have lost ad revenue altogether, which the post addresses:  If you think your video was demonetized in error, request an appeal by clicking on the yellow $ icon next to the video in Video Manager.

       " 'Elon Musk s SpaceX makes history by launching a  flight-proven  rocket: From a distance, it looked like any other rocket at Florida s Kennedy Space Center, a soaring tower of thrust and power, ready to blast off into orbit. Upon closer inspection, though, there were signs of something different about this rocket. The Falcon 9 s first-stage booster was not as clean and shiny as they usually are. It was just a touch dull, showing, ever so slightly, the scorched wear from its first launch, almost a year ago   a  flight-proven  rocket, as Elon Musk s SpaceX likes to call it. On Thursday evening, almost one year after it had previously flown the Falcon 9 rocket, SpaceX launched it again. The launch, at 6:27 p.m., marked the first time that a rocket had flown a payload to orbit, landed vertically and then been reused. The flight signaled an important landmark, capping years of work and some fiery theatrics of boosters screaming back from space only to explode in failed attempts to land on ships at sea. In December 2015, SpaceX was able to land its first rocket on a landing pad at Cape Canaveral. A few months later, the company did it again, this time at sea. Since then, it has made landing rockets as exciting   or more so   than the 3-2-1, bone-rattling liftoffs of fire and smoke that have reignited interest in space exploration. After the successful launch, an emotional Musk called it  an incredible milestone in the history of space. ',\n",
       " 'Embattled Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey leaves Facebook: Palmer Luckey is out at Facebook. The Oculus co-founder, who helped kickstart the recent VR craze with a prototype headset built out of his parents  garage, has left the company after a year that heralded the launch of the consumer Oculus Rift but also a number of lawsuits and a pro-Trump meme scandal. Oculus has confirmed the report of Luckey s departure, first spotted by UploadVR, in a statement to TechCrunch that reads about as much as a eulogy as it does a farewell. In an era filled with seemingly countless examples of  bro  founders emerging from top universities and starting companies with their frat brothers, Luckey appeared to be a breath of fresh air. The home-schooled college dropout was a tinkerer who frequented message boards asking for help taking apart and rebuilding game consoles in his parents  garage before expanding to a deep interest in 3D screens and head-mounted displays. This fascination eventually brought him to encounter legendary game developer John Carmack, who helped the young Luckey gain the attention of the gaming community after showcasing one of his VR headset prototypes at a major gaming conference. The excitement led to a wildly successful Kickstarter campaign that later brought the interest of some major investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund and Formation 8. Facebook acquired Oculus in March of 2014 for $2 billion. Luckey has not commented on what exactly he earned from the deal, but Forbes pins his net worth at $730 million. Luckey s departure follows a lengthy period of absence from public view brought about by a Daily Beast piece revealing his involvement and funding of a pro-Trump troll group called Nimble America. News of his support came during a time when very few figures in Silicon Valley were publicly showing support for candidate Trump, the most notable being Peter Thiel, an early investor in Facebook who started the VC firm Founders Fund, which backed Oculus, as well.']"

    "article = \"Infosys Ltd, despite a relatively good performance over the past two years, is battling perceptions of under-performance because of its inability to keep pace with its ambitious target of more than doubling its revenue to $20 billion by March 2021. This target appears to have done more harm than good: analysts continue to rate the company using it as a metric; and people in the know attribute the departure of at least a few senior executives over the past few years to it. Now, an analyst at a foreign brokerage has suggested that the company is better off without the target. “Management continues to maintain ‘aspirational’ revenue and margin targets that are increasingly becoming unlikely to be achieved, in our opinion. Given Infy (Infosys) is now guiding to lower levels of both revenue growth and margins in FY18 (2017-18), we think management would be well-served to either amend or drop its aspirational targets,” Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 16 April. Since outlining this target, Sikka steered Infosys to dollar revenue growth of 9.1% in 2015-16 and 7.4% in 2016-17; for the second consecutive year, Infosys will grow faster than its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and cross-town peer Wipro Ltd (Wipro). Still, Infosys continues to be evaluated on the progress it makes in becoming a $20 billion company. Worryingly for the management, a bigger fallout of the targets has been the pressure on senior leaders, making a few of them leave. Since April 2015, half-a-dozen executive vice-presidents (EVPs) and a dozen senior vice-presidents (SVPs) have quit. Not all departures are on account of the targets but two former executives admit that they left Infosys as they could not keep up with the “impossible targets.”\""
